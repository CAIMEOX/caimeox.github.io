\title{Einstein's Summation Convention}
\taxon{Definition}
\p{
    When index variable appears twicec in a single term and
    is not otherwise defined, it is assumed to be summed over.
    If the indices can range over #{\{1,2,3\}},then
    ##{
        s = \sum_{i=1}^3 a_i b_i = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3
    }
    can be simplified to
    ##{
        s = a_i b_i
    }
}
