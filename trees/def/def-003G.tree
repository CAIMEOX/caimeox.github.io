\taxon{Definition}
\p{
    A \strong{functor} #{F} from a category #{C} to a category #{D} is a map
    sending each #{x\in C} to an object #{F(x)\in D} and each morphism
    #{f:x\to y} in #{C} to morphism #{F(f):F(x)\to F(y)} in #{D}, such that 
    \ul{
        \li{
            Composition is preserved: #{F(g\circ f) = F(g)\circ F(f)}.
        }
        \li{
            Identity is preserved: #{F(\id_x) = \id_{F(x)}}.
        }
    }
