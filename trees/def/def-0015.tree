\title{Judgemental Equality}
\taxon{Definition}
\p{
    \strong{Judgemental equality} of terms is given by the following judgement:
    ##{
        \Gamma\vdash a\equiv a':A
    }
    #{a} and #{a'} are judgementally equal terms of type #{A} in context #{\Gamma}.
}
\p{
    Note that the notation #{\equiv} binds more loosely than anything else.
