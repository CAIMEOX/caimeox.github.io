\title{First Minor and Cofactor}
\taxon{Definition}
\p{
    If #{A} is a square matrix, then the \strong{minor} of the entry in the i-th row and j-th 
    column (also called the #{(i, j)} minor, or a first minor) is the \strong{determinant} of 
    the sub-matrix formed by deleting the i-th row and j-th column.
    The #{(i, j)} minor is denoted as #{M_{ij}}.
    The \strong{Cofactor} is obtained by multiplying the minor by #{(-1)^{i+j}}.
