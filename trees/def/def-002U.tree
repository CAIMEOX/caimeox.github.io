\title{Equivalence Class}
\taxon{Definition}
\p{
    Let #{\sim} be an [equivalence relation](def-000X) on a set #{A}.
    For any element #{a\in A}, the \strong{equivalence class} of #{a} is the set
    #{[a] = \set{b\in A:b\sim a}}.
    The set of all equivalence classes is denoted by #{A/\sim},
    which is called the \strong{quotient set} of #{A} by #{\sim}.
    \p{
        The equivalence class of #{a} is also denoted by #{\overline{a}}.
    }
