\title{Direct Sum}
\taxon{Definition}
\p{
    Let #{U_1, \dots, U_n} be subspaces of a vector space #{V}.
    The \strong{direct sum} of #{U_1, \dots, U_n} is defined as
    ##{
        U_1 \oplus \dots \oplus U_n = \{u_1 + \dots + u_n \mid u_i \in U_i\}
    }
    if every element in #{U_1 \oplus \dots \oplus U_n} can be written as #{u_1 + \dots + u_n } in only one way.
    This definition requires every vector in the sum have a unique representation.
