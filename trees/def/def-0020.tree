\p{
        
        The \strong{unit type} is the simplest inductive type.
        It has only one constructor, denoted by #{\star:\unit}.
    }
\p{
        The induction principle of the unit type is trivial.
        It says that to define a dependent function #{f:\Pi _{(x:\unit)} P(x)}, 
        it suffices to give a value #{p:P(\star)}.

            f (\star) :\equiv p
