    Let #{X} be a set and #{n \in \N}. 
    #{A} si said to have \strong{cardinality} #{n}, denoted by #{ |A|= n},
    if there exists an isomorphism between #{A} and #{S_n = \set{1,2,\cdots,n}}.
    If #{A} has finite cardinality, we say #{A} is \strong{finite}, otherwise
    we say #{A} is \strong{infinite}, denoted by #{|A| \geq \infty}.
