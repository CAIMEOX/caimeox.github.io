\title{#{\mathcal{P}_m (R)}}
\taxon{Definition}
\p{
    The set of all polynomials of degree at most #{m} with coefficients in ring #{R} is denoted by #{\mathcal{P}_m (R)}.
    In other words,
    ##{
        \mathcal{P}_m (R) = \set{ p \in \mathcal{P}(R) | \deg(p) \leq m}
    }
    where #{\mathcal{P}(R)} is the [set of all polynomials](def-0027) with coefficients in #{R}.
