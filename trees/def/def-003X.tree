\title{Dual Space}
\taxon{Definition}
\p{
    Let #{V} be a vector space over a field #{F}, 
    the \strong{(algebraic) dual space} #{V^*} (#{V^\lor}) is defined as 
    the set of all linear maps #{T:V\to F} (linear functionals).
    The dual space itself is a vector space where the elements are sometimes 
    called \strong{covectors} or \strong{one forms} or \strong{linear forms}.
