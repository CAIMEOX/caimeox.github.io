\title{Partial Order}
\taxon{Definition}
\p{
    A \strong{(non-strict) partial order} is a relation #{\leq} that is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.
    \ul{
        \li{Reflexive: #{a\leq a}}
        \li{Antisymmetric: #{a\leq b} and #{b\leq a} implies #{a=b}}
        \li{Transitive: #{a\leq b} and #{b\leq c} implies #{a\leq c}}
    }
    A non-strict partial order is also known as an antisymmetric [preorder](def-000Z).
