\title{Models of algebraic theories}
\taxon{Definition}
\p{
    A \strong{model} #{M} of an algebraic theory #{T} is an interpretation of the signature #{\Sigma_T} 
    which validates all the equations #{E_T}.
    That is, for each equations #{x_1, \cdots, x_k \mid l = r} in #{E_T}, we have:
    ##{
        [x_1, \cdots, x_k \mid l]_M = [x_1, \cdots, x_k \mid r]_M
    }
    We refer to a model of #{T} as a #{T\text{-algebra}} or #{T\text{-model}}.
