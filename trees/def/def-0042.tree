\p{
    In \strong{Euclidean space}, a \strong{Euclidean vector} is a geometric object that possesses both 
    a norm and a direction. The \strong{dot product} of two vectors #{\vec{a}} and #{\vec{b}} is defined as
    ##{
        \vec{a}\cdot\vec{b} = \norm{\vec{a}}\norm{\vec{b}}\cos\theta
    }
    where #{\theta} is the angle between the two vectors.
