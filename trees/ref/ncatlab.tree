    [\strong{nLab}](https://ncatlab.org/) is a wiki for collaborative work on Mathematics, Physics, and Philosophy â€” 
    especially (but far from exclusively) from the higher structures point of view: 
    with a sympathy towards the tools and perspectives of homotopy theory/algebraic topology, 
    homotopy type theory, higher category theory and higher categorical algebra.
