\p{
    Consider a particle of mass #{m} moving along #{x}-axis
    subject to force #{F(x, t)}.
    With Newton's second law, we have:
    ##{
        F = ma
    }
    For \strong{conservative systems}, the force
    can be expressed as the derivative of a \strong{potential energy}.
    ##{
        F = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}
    }
    Now the equation of motion becomes:
    ##{
        m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}
    }
    With appropriate initial conditions we can determine the #{x(t)},
    this is what we normally do in classic mechanics.
}
\p{
    For \strong{Quantum Mechanics}, we have a different perspective.
    We would like to look for the \strong{wave function}, #{\psi(x, t)}.
    To determine it we need to solve the \strong{Schrodinger equation}.
    ##{
        i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi(x,t) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2\psi(x,t)}{\partial x^2} + V(x,t)\psi(x,t)
    }
}
\transclude{def-0030}
\p{
    The role of Schrodinger equation is similar to the role of Newton's second law in classic mechanics.
    Given proper initial conditions,
    we can determine #{\psi(x, t)} for all the future time.
}
\p{
    The wave function is quite odd, what information does it carry?
    The wave function is \em{spread out} in space.
    How can this be related to the \strong{state} of a particle.
}
\p{
    \strong{Born's statistical interpretation} of the wave function provides an answer.
    For a fixed time #{t}, the probability of finding the particle in the interval #{[a, b]} is given by:
    ##{
        P(a, b) = \int_a^b |{\psi(x, t)}|^2 dx
    }
}
\p{
    Here is where the quantum mechanics differs from classic mechanics and behaves weirdly.
    The wave function is not a deterministic function, but a \em{statistical} function, which 
    is an \strong{indeterministic} interpretation.
}
\p{
    Suppose I do \strong{measure} the position of the particle,
    and find it at #{\vec{r}_0}.
    Then where it was before the measurement?
    There are many interpretations of this question,
    and I will explain three of them.
}
\p{
    \ul{
        \li{\strong{Realist interpretation}: The particle has a definite position before the measurement, just at #{\vec{r}_0} but we just don't know it.}
        \li{\strong{Orthodox interpretation}: The particle doesn't have a \em{definite} position before the measurement, it is in a \strong{superposition} of all possible positions.
        This is also called the \strong{Copenhagen interpretation}.}
        \li{\strong{Agnostic interpretation}: The question is meaningless, refuse to answer.}
    }
}
\p{
    Nowadays, the Copenhagen interpretation is the most widely accepted interpretation.
    The particle does not have a definite position before the measurement.
    The operation of measurement \strong{collapses} the wave function to a definite position.
}
\p{
    Probability is the key concept in quantum mechanics.
    Now I will introduce some terimnologies related to continuous probability.
}
\transclude{def-0031}
\p{
    Now go back to quantum mechanics.
    We have seen that the squared wave function #{|\psi(x,t)|^2} is a probability density.
    So it satisfies
    ##{
        \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x,t)|^2 dx = 1
    }
}
\p{
    Solve the equations we will get a set of solutions.
    We should pick a proper factor to make the wave function \strong{normalized}.
    But if I have normalized the wave function at time #{t_0},
    will it stay normalized at all future time?
    Fortunately the Schrodinger equation guarantees the normalization of 
    the wave function.
    \proof{
        Differentiate the normalization condition with respect to time:
        ##{
            \frac{d}{dt}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x,t)|^2 dx = 
            \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi(x,t)|^2 dx
        }
        With the product rule:
        ##{
            \frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi(x,t)|^2 = 
            \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi(x,t)\psi^*(x,t) + \psi(x,t)\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi^*(x,t)
        }
        where #{\psi^*(x,t)} is the \strong{complex conjugate} of #{\psi(x,t)}.
        The Schrodinger equation gives
        ##{
            \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t} = \frac{i\hbar}{2m}\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{iV}{\hbar}\psi
        }
        and also the complex conjugate
        ##{
            \frac{\partial\psi^*}{\partial t} = -\frac{i\hbar}{2m}\frac{\partial^2\psi^*}{\partial x^2} + \frac{iV}{\hbar}\psi^*
        }
        so
        ##{
            \begin{align*}
                \frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi(x,t)|^2 &= 
                \frac{i\hbar}{2m}\left( \frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x^2}\psi^* - \frac{\partial^2\psi^*}{\partial x^2}\psi \right)\\
                &= \frac{i\hbar}{2m}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}\psi^* - \frac{\partial\psi^*}{\partial x}\psi \right)
            \end{align*}
        }
        Now the integral becomes:
        ##{
            \frac{d}{dt}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x,t)|^2 dx = 
            \frac{i\hbar}{2m}\left( \psi\frac{\partial\psi^*}{\partial x} - \psi^*\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x} \right)\Big|_{-\infty}^{\infty}
        }
        Because the \strong{normalization condition}
        ##{
            \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x,t)|^2 dx = 1
        }
        implies that the wave function vanishes at infinity,
        that is, converges to zero at infinity. Hence we have
        ##{
            \lim_{|x|\to\infty}|\psi(x,t)| = 0
        }
        this indicates that the integral is zero.
        ##{
            \frac{d}{dt}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x,t)|^2 dx = 0
        }
        Now we can conclude that the wave function stays normalized at all future time.
    }
}
\p{
    For a particle in state #{\psi}, we have defined its \strong{expectation value}:
    ##{
        \langle x \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x|\psi(x,t)|^2 dx
    }
    Can we give a meaning to it? Is it the \strong{average} position of the particle? 
    No, the first measurement of the position of the particle will give a definite position,
    and the subsequent measurements will give the same result.
}
\p{
    Actually, the expectation value is the \em{average} of 
    repeated measurements on an ensemble of identical prepared systems,
    not the average of repeated measurements on a \em{single} system.
}
\block{\strong{Construction.}}{
    As times goes on, the expectation values varies.
    We naturally ask how fast it moves?
    Use simple calculus we can get the answer.
    ##{
        \begin{align*}
            \frac{d}{dt}\langle x \rangle &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi(x,t)|^2 dx \\
            &= \frac{i\hbar}{2m}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x\frac{\partial}{\partial x} (\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}\psi^* + \psi\frac{\partial\psi^*}{\partial x}) dx
        \end{align*}
    }
    Simplify using integration by parts, we get
    ##{
        \frac{d}{dt}\langle x \rangle = -\frac{i\hbar}{2m}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left( \psi^*\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x} - \psi\frac{\partial\psi^*}{\partial x} \right) dx
    }
    Note that the boundary term was eliminated because the wave function vanishes at infinity.
    Perform integration by parts again on the second term
    ##{
        \langle v \rangle :\equiv\frac{d}{dt}\langle x \rangle = -\frac{i\hbar}{m}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi^*\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x} dx
    }
    Note that we give a name to the integral, #{v}, indicating the \strong{velocity} of the expectation value.
}
\p{
    To work with \strong{momentum}, we can define:
    ##{
        \langle p \rangle = m \langle v \rangle = -i\hbar\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi^*\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x} dx
    }
    Rewrite as an \strong{operator} form:
    ##{
        \langle p \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi^*\left( \frac{\hbar}{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right)\psi dx
    }
    Compare with 
    ##{
        \langle x \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi^*(x)\psi dx
    }
}
\p{
    That's interesting, an operator that acts on the wave function and gives position and momentum.
    We can generalize this to any function of position and momentum.
    Just simply do substitution:
    ##{
        \langle Q(x,p) \rangle = 
        \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi^*(x)Q\left( x, -i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right)\psi dx
    }
    Momentum and position are just special cases of this general formula.
    We will give a firmer theoretical foundation to this equation later.
    Now we just use it as an \em{axiom}.
