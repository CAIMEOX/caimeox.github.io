\title{Work-Energy Principle}
\taxon{Principle}
\p{
    An increase in the kinetic energy of a \strong{rigid body} is caused by an equal amount 
    of positive work done on the body by the resultant force acting on that body. 
    Conversely, a decrease in kinetic energy is caused by an equal amount of negative work done by the resultant force.
