    This post discuss the universe in type theory,
    based on Egbert Rijke's [Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory](hott-2022) and [NLab](ncatlab).
    In this post, we regard universe as the representation of types in an internal model 
    of the type theory (\strong{Tarski universe} or \strong{universe Ã  la Tarski}).
}
\p{
    A universe consist of a type #{\mathcal{U}} with a type family #{\T} over #{\U}.
    Forall #{X:\U} we think of #{X} as an \strong{encoding} (representation) of the actual type #{\T(X)}.
    The type family #{\T} is therefore called a \strong{unversal type family}.
}
\p{
    There several reasons to equip type theory with universes.
    It enables us to define new type families over inductive types, using induction principle.
    For instance, we can define \strong{relations} over #{\N}, such as ordering relations #{\leq}.
    We will soon meet the idea of \strong{observational equality} for a particular type, different from identity types.
    Another reason is that it allows us to define types equipped with structure such as group.

    \title{Observational Equality}
    \p{
        Now we give the example of \strong{observational equality} of #{\N}.
        The key idea is to define a recursive function that reduce the arguments.
        Observational equality an inductively defined relation, which gives us an algorithm for checking
        equality on  #{\N}. It can be used to show that equality of natural numbers is \strong{decidable}.

    \transclude{def-004H}
    \p{
        Observational equality of #{\N} is a reflexive relation, i.e. we have
        ##{
            \text{refl-Eq}_\N:\Pi_{(n:\N)}\text{Eq}_\N(n,n)
        }
        which is witnessed by induction on #{n}.
        ##{
            \begin{align*}
                \text{refl-Eq}_\N(0) &\equiv\star \\ 
                \text{refl-Eq}_\N(\succ(n)) &\equiv\text{refl-Eq}_\N(n)
            \end{align*}
        }
    }
    \p{
        This leads to an interesting dual perspective on equality. 
        For any two natural numbers #{m} and #{n} we have
        ##{
            (m=n)\leftrightarrow\text{Eq}_\N(m,n)
        }
    }
    \p{
        Using the observational equality of #{\N} we can prove Peano's seventh and eighth
        axioms.

                    (m = n)\leftrightarrow(\succ(m) = \succ(n))
                }
            }
            \li{
                For any natural number #{n} we have #{0 \not= \succ(n)}
            }
